ok we are making a fun game called "party line" in it you enter a URL and then select from a number of personas which are represented by the following:
[ emoji | persona description ]

these are toggles ... then you press "call the party line" and this does a server request to something you are not supposed to build ... but the request should be 

{ url: "url", personas: [persona1_id, persona2_id] }

After this an id is returned corresponding to the call

The id then can be used for buttons that are after each persona. You have "add to call" and if the user presses that than a request

add_to_call is sent with the {id: <id returned>, persona: <persona_id>}

there's also "hangup" to remove the person from the call, this would invoke

remove_from_call {id: <call_id>, persona: <persona_id>}
